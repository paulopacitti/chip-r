- A simple (with hidden bugs ðŸ‘€) [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator built with **rust**.
- Tested on `macos`, but since it uses `sdl2` it can be compiled to multiple targets.

### Usage
 - Compile `core`: `cd core && cargo build`
 - Compile and **run** the emulator: `cd frontend && cargo run <path-to-rom>`

 ### Controls
 Controls in CHIP-8 implementations are based on a 4x4 keyboard. In `chip-r`, these are the controls:
```
Keyboard           
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q | W | E | R |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | S | D | F |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z | X | C | V |
|---|---|---|---|
```
