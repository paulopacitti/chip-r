- A simple (with hidden bugs ðŸ‘€) [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator built with **rust**.
- Tested on `macos`, but since it uses `sdl2` it can be compiled to multiple targets.

### Usage
 - Compile `core`: `cd core && cargo build`
 - Compile and **run** the emulator: `cd frontend && cargo run <path-to-rom>`

 ### Resources
 - I've built this to learn about emulation development and learn more about `rust`. Here's the guide that helped me through this journey: https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book
